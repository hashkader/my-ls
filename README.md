# Welcome to My Ls
***

## Task
The task is to create a simplified version of the ls command-line utility in C.
The challenge lies in implementing features such as sorting files and directories alphabetically or by modification time,
handling command-line arguments, and efficiently obtaining file details from directories.

## Description
This program, "My Ls", is a simplified version of the ls command-line utility found in Unix-like operating systems.
It allows users to list files and directories in the specified directory/directories and supports sorting based on either lexical order or modification time.

## Installation
Run the make command to compile the project.
Upon successful compilation, an executable named my_ls will be generated.

## Usage
To use "My Ls", follow the usage format below:

./my_ls [-a] [-t] [directory1] [directory2] ...
